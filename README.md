# LasISC-Hostel

## Description
This project represent a managment of one hotel (Clients, chambers, reservations, services) in a database. We are using PostGres for this.
The time we have for this is 2 weeks.

## Why this choice?

We choose this topic because we found it interesting. We still find hotel that doesn't have a computerised system for the check-in or the check-out, so it would be useful for people who works on this topic, especially for small business. We want the administration to be simple and easy.

## Complexity / Particularity / Modelisation

We decide to not be further than one hotel, because we are limited in time, and we found it complex enough without a chain of hotels. We also thought about adding a restaurant or other services, but for the same reason, we agreed not to go further, except we find the time.

## Challenges
The challenge we expect to uncounter are:
  - the management of the reservation (dates, an reservation in advance), with insert and the queries.
  - the management of the time and our complexity of the project.

## Metrics

Our hotel has 12 floors, with around 4 to 10 rooms each. It has 4 deluxe rooms, 50 standard single rooms, 30 standards double rooms, 10 superior rooms and 2 suites with one superior suite. It has 123 customers today, with 20 leaving tomorrow. We have 2 employees in charge of the cleaning of each floor, and 4 for welcoming the guests.

## Filling the table

We think finding some random customer names will be easy to generates, and the other already has some terminology (single, double, triple, ... or standard, superior, deluxe and suites), so we don't think we will have some trouble to create it.
