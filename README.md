# LasISC-Hostel

## Description
This project represent a managment of one hotel (Clients, chambers, reservations, services) in a database. We are using PostGres for this.
The time we have for this is 2 weeks.

## Why this choice?

We choose this topic because we found it interesting. We still have hotel that doesn't have a informatized service for register everything, so it would be useful for people who works on this topic, especially for small business. We want the administration to be simple and easy.

## Complexity / Particularity

We decide to not be further than one hotel, because we are limited in time, and we found it complex enough without a chain of hotels. We also thought about adding a restaurant or other services, but for the same reason, we agreed not to go further, except we find the time

## Challenges
The challenge we expect to uncounter are:
  - the management of the reservation (dates, an reservation in advance)
  -
